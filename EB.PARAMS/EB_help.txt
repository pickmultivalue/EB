ý - The [F8] key can be used to filter
EB .ýEdit last file/program
EB ..ýEdit previous to last file (pops last file)
EB <filename> {<itemlist>}ýSimilar to ED/JED, can be run from a list
EB <fullpath_to_file>ýSimilar to JED, but multiple paths can be entered
EB <program> {<program>}ýEnter one or more cataloged programs/subroutines
EBFIND <options>ýSearch for items with matching text and invoke EB

Editing tips:
- pressing <enter> will split the line at the current cursor
- pressing <del> anywere after the last character merges the line below
- pressing <tab> on a blank line tries to determine the correct indentation
- When shelling out to jshell ([F10]) press ctrl-D to return
- All search/replace prompts support up/down and [F2] to reuse previous
- New programs default to a single comment line with PROGRAM
  Press [F2], then "s" to convert to SUBROUTINE and again to FUNCTION
